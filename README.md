Tic tac toe game created during 45-minutes programming session + my comments.

## How to buil the game
### macOS / Linux
1. Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/botantony/tic-tac-toe.git` command to the folder you want
2. Run `make` command
3. Run the program using `./main` command

### Windows
Honestly I haven't worked with Windows for a while. The easiest way would be to open any IDE that supports C, copy the content of `main.c` file, and run it.
